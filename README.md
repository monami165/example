# Getting Started

If using VSC (I've used VSC to develop this), make sure you have the 'Live Server' plugin downloaded for previews

Be sure to download the necessary dependencies before running the project:

- npm install

To startup the json server:

- json-server --watch data/db.json --port 3002

To start up project (on port 3000):

- npm start

Link to the project on the browser:

- localhost:3000
